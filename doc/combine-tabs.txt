INTRODUCTION                                    *combine-tabs*

This plugin is for combining tabs. To move the buffer from the
current window to a window in the previous tab, call
MoveToPrevTab or use the mapping tP. To move to the next tab,
use MoveToNextTab or tN. To prevent the mappings from being
set, set g:surround_no_mappings before the mapping is loaded.
